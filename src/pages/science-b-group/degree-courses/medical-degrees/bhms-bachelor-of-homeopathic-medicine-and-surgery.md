BHMS stands for Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery, which is an undergraduate degree program in the field of homeopathy. Homeopathy is a system of medicine that is based on the principle of "like cures like" and uses natural substances to stimulate the body's natural healing processes.

The BHMS program is designed to provide students with knowledge of the principles and practices of homeopathy. The curriculum includes a wide range of subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, microbiology, materia medica, pharmacy, repertory, and various clinical specialties such as psychiatry, dermatology, and pediatrics.

During the BHMS program, students gain practical experience by working in homeopathic hospitals and clinics under the guidance of experienced homeopathic practitioners. They learn how to diagnose and treat diseases using homeopathic principles and practices.

Upon completion of the BHMS program, graduates can work as homeopathic practitioners in government or private hospitals, clinics, research institutions, and other healthcare organizations, or they can start their own practice. They can also pursue postgraduate studies in various specialties such as pediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, and materia medica, among others.
