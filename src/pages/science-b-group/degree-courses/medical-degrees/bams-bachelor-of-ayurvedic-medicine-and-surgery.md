BAMS stands for Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, which is an undergraduate degree program in the field of Ayurveda. Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India and is based on natural healing practices.

The BAMS program is designed to provide students with knowledge of the principles and practices of Ayurveda. The curriculum includes a wide range of subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, toxicology, preventive and social medicine, Ayurvedic classics, and various clinical specialties such as Kaya Chikitsa (Internal Medicine), Shalya Tantra (Surgery), Shalakya Tantra (ENT), and Prasuti Tantra and Stri Roga (Obstetrics and Gynecology).

During the BAMS program, students gain practical experience by working in Ayurvedic hospitals and clinics under the guidance of experienced Ayurvedic practitioners. They learn how to diagnose and treat diseases using Ayurvedic principles and practices.

Upon completion of the BAMS program, graduates can work as Ayurvedic practitioners in government or private hospitals, clinics, research institutions, and other healthcare organizations, or they can start their own practice. They can also pursue postgraduate studies in various specialties such as Panchakarma, Kayachikitsa, Shalya Tantra, and Shalakya Tantra, among others.
